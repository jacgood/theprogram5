# CI/CD Implementation PRD
## Product Requirements Document

### Executive Summary
Implement a complete CI/CD pipeline using GitHub Actions with self-hosted runners to automate testing, building, and deployment of a web application to local development and production environments.

### Project Scope
- Set up GitHub Actions workflows for automated CI/CD
- Configure self-hosted GitHub Actions runner on local server
- Create separate development and production environments
- Implement automated testing, building, and deployment processes
- Establish proper environment configuration management

### Technical Requirements

#### Environment Setup
- **Development Environment**: Port 3000, separate database/config
- **Production Environment**: Port 8080, separate database/config
- **Both environments** should run simultaneously on the same local server
- Use environment-specific configuration files
- Implement proper logging and monitoring for both environments

#### GitHub Actions Configuration
- **Self-hosted runner** installed and configured on local server
- **Development workflow** triggered on pushes to `dev` branch
- **Production workflow** triggered on pushes to `main` branch
- **Pull request workflow** for running tests on PRs
- Workflows should include: linting, testing, building, and deployment steps

#### Security & Configuration
- Environment variables properly managed (separate .env files)
- Sensitive data (API keys, database credentials) stored securely
- GitHub Secrets configured for deployment credentials
- Proper file permissions and access controls

#### Deployment Strategy
- **Zero-downtime deployment** for production environment
- **Rollback capability** in case of deployment failures
- **Health checks** after deployment
- **Backup strategy** before production deployments

### Functional Requirements

#### Development Workflow
1. Developer pushes code to `dev` branch
2. GitHub Actions triggers development pipeline
3. Pipeline runs tests and linting
4. If tests pass, code is deployed to development environment
5. Deployment notification sent (optional)

#### Production Workflow
1. Code merged from `dev` to `main` branch
2. GitHub Actions triggers production pipeline
3. Pipeline runs comprehensive tests
4. If tests pass, production backup is created
5. Code is deployed to production environment
6. Health checks verify deployment success
7. Deployment notification sent

#### Testing Requirements
- Unit tests execution
- Integration tests (if applicable)
- Code quality checks (linting, formatting)
- Security scanning (basic)
- Performance tests (optional)

### Technical Deliverables

#### GitHub Actions Workflows
- `.github/workflows/dev-deploy.yml` - Development deployment workflow
- `.github/workflows/prod-deploy.yml` - Production deployment workflow
- `.github/workflows/pr-check.yml` - Pull request validation workflow

#### Configuration Files
- Environment-specific configuration files
- Docker configuration (if using containers)
- Database migration scripts
- Deployment scripts for both environments

#### Self-hosted Runner Setup
- GitHub Actions runner installation and configuration
- Service configuration for automatic startup
- Proper permissions and security setup
- Runner maintenance scripts

#### Environment Management
- Separate database setup for dev/prod
- Environment variable management
- Log rotation and management
- Backup and restore scripts

### Implementation Steps

#### Phase 1: Environment Setup
1. Configure development environment on port 3000
2. Configure production environment on port 8080
3. Set up separate databases/configurations
4. Create environment-specific configuration files

#### Phase 2: GitHub Actions Runner
1. Install GitHub Actions self-hosted runner
2. Configure runner as a service
3. Set up proper permissions and security
4. Test runner connectivity

#### Phase 3: CI/CD Workflows
1. Create GitHub Actions workflows
2. Configure GitHub Secrets
3. Implement deployment scripts
4. Set up testing pipeline

#### Phase 4: Testing & Validation
1. Test development deployment workflow
2. Test production deployment workflow
3. Validate rollback procedures
4. Test health checks and monitoring

#### Phase 5: Documentation & Monitoring
1. Create deployment documentation
2. Set up basic monitoring
3. Create troubleshooting guides
4. Implement notification system

### Success Criteria
- Automated deployment to dev environment on `dev` branch pushes
- Automated deployment to prod environment on `main` branch merges
- Zero manual intervention required for standard deployments
- Rollback capability functional and tested
- All tests passing in CI pipeline
- Environments properly isolated and configured
- Documentation complete and accessible

### Technical Constraints
- Single local server hosting both environments
- GitHub Actions as the CI/CD platform
- Self-hosted runner on local infrastructure
- Budget constraints (free/open-source tools preferred)

### Assumptions
- Local server has sufficient resources for both environments
- Internet connectivity available for GitHub Actions
- Basic understanding of Git workflow (dev â†’ main branches)
- Application can be configured to run on different ports
- Database can be configured for multiple environments

### Risk Mitigation
- **Single point of failure**: Document backup and restore procedures
- **Resource constraints**: Monitor server resources, implement alerts
- **Security**: Limit runner permissions, secure sensitive data
- **Network issues**: Implement retry logic in deployment scripts

### Future Considerations
- Container orchestration (Docker Compose/Kubernetes)
- Automated database migrations
- Performance monitoring integration
- Multi-server deployment
- Blue-green deployment strategy
